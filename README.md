# Survey on online and distance learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

As the COVID-19 pandemic has led to massive educational institutional (like college, institutes, universities, schools, etc)  closures across many countries have taken measures to limit the disruption to education, necessitating a move to online and distance learning, encompassing not only secondary level but also primary level.

Although distance learning offers obvious advantages for both teachers and students, such as continuity, flexibility and mutual support, many teachers have had to adjust to online teaching owing to the necessarily short notice. On top of that, it is difficult for teachers to ensure that all pupils, especially the disadvantaged and young ones, will stay engaged and take part in classes online.

This survey is to explore opinions on online and distance teaching/learning from across India from the point of view of students, teachers and parents using different set of questions according to category the user belongs to.

Basically, with the help of survey we are finding whether the respondents want to continue with the currently ongoing distance teaching/learning or they want to shift back to the general mode that is offline mode as the situation gets normal or they want the blended mode of teaching/learning which includes online + offline both.

Also, we are finding out what are the advantages and disadvantages respondents faced while having distance learning/teachings and whether it affected them or not. And what measures should be taken to improve this type of learning if the conditions not get well.

# Conclusion 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our survey attracted around 100 respondents where approximately 50 are students and around 20-30 are teachers from different educational institutes and different fields including primary level, secondary level, undergrads, postgraduate and PHD and also around 10 respondents are from parents category.

Almost every respondent reported challenges, the most frequent being access to technology, for both pupils and teachers, and increased workload and stress working from home. Several challenges related to supporting pupils were identified, together with their digital competence â€“ and that of teachers.

Respondents feel that support in terms of more educational resources would help them meet the challenges, as well as clear guidance from the Ministry of Education, together with professional development, such as short courses on online teaching and opportunities for teachers to share resources, ideas and challenges.

These findings offer some early indications to policymakers and educational leaders that the experience of distance/online teaching and learning, although challenging, may have lasting positive effects, opening up interesting possibilities for innovation and new ways of working, especially if supported by appropriate and timely professional development.
